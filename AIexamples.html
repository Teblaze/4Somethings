				<br> <br> <h1>Early uses</h1> <br>
During the early 1970s to early 1980s, there was a huge videogame boom, with many of these games utilizing artificial intelligence, some of these are more basic than others, but still considered AI nonetheless. Games like Pac-Man and Gallaga utilizes AI to put pressure on the player, this creates a more enjoyable experience as they are unpredictable, this technique is still used to this day. Some games would most likely not even function without the use of AI, for instance, The 1972 game titled “Pong” is a game about constantly hitting a “ball” back and forth with another player, this other player happens to be Artificial Intelligence. The AI in pong always knows where the ball will land, and without a RNG(Random Number Generator) modifier that determines if the opponent misses or not, if not for this, it would be impossible to win.<br><br> <h4>*Related to Timeline*</h4>
